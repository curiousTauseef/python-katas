Cyclic array rotation. Given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, return the array A shifted to the right by K indices.

#### Binary gap
Find the longest sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of an integer N.

#### Count div
Compute the number of integers divisible by k in range [a, b].

#### Distinct pythonic
Calculate the number of distinct valueas in an array A. A pythonic one-liner.

#### Distinct unpythonic
Calculate the number of distinct values in an array A. Probably the expected solution (the exercise is meant to use sorting).
