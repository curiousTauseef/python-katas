Training exercises from [Codility](https://www.codility.com). Probably correct, at least according to the autograder (all score 100%).

#### Array rotation
Cyclic array rotation. Given a zero-indexed array `A` consisting of `N` integers, return the array `A` shifted to the right by `K` indices.

#### Binary gap
Find the longest sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of an integer `N`.

#### Count div
Compute the number of integers divisible by `k` in range `[a, b]`.

#### Distinct pythonic
Calculate the number of distinct valueas in an array `A` using a pythonic one-liner.

#### Distinct unpythonic
Calculate the number of distinct values in an array `A`. Probably the expected solution (the exercise is meant to use sorting).

#### Frog jump
A frog is located at position `X` and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to `Y`. The frog always jumps a fixed distance `D`. Return the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

#### Max counter


#### Max profit

#### Min perimeter rectangle

#### Odd occurences in array
Find the only element of a non-empty array `A` of `N` integers that occurs odd number of times.

#### Passing cars

#### Permutation missing element
Find the missing element in a given permutation.

#### String symmetry point

#### Tape equilibrium
Find an integer `P` that splits a non-empty array `A` into two non-empty parts: A<sub>1</sup>=A[0], ..., A[P-1] and A<sub>1</sub>=A[P], ..., A[N-1] such that A<sub>1</sub>=A<sub>2</sub>.
