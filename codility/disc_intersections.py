"""
There are N discs on a plane, numbered from 0 to N-1.
You are given an array A of N non-negative integers.
The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].
Two disc intersect if they have at least one common point (including the border).
Write a function that returns the number of unordered pairs of intersecting discs.
The function should return âˆ’1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10M.
